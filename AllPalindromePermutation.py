'''
  write a program that gets all the possible palindromes of a word

  Algorithm 1: find all permutations of a string and as you do check if the word is a palindrome or not.

  Algorithm 2: make sure that the following criteria have been satisfied first:

              1. length of word is odd
              2. every word except one has a pair
              3. find all permutations of one half of the exact pair of strings and the palindromic permutation will be concatenation of this permutation + single pair letter + the same permutation
